      Eco Pallet Company was founded in 2017. Initially, the brand specialized
      in the production of standard pallets. However, over the course of a year,
      Eco Pallet expanded its product line significantly, adding boxes, pyramid
      stacks, pallet blanks, and firewood.


      At the same time, we mastered the art of custom orders, producing pallets of non-standard dimensions on demand. A year later, in 2019, our company received a European license for the production of EPAL pallets.
