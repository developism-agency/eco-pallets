      Eco Pallet Company was founded in 2017. Initially, the brand specialized
      in the production of standard pallets. However, over the course of a year,
      Eco Pallet expanded its product line significantly, adding boxes, pyramid
      stacks, pallet blanks, and firewood.




      At the same time, we mastered the art of custom orders, producing pallets of non-standard dimensions on demand. A year later, in 2019, our company received a European license for the production of EPAL pallets.

          You no longer have to spend time chopping firewood — we did it for
          you!




          The Eco Pallet range includes dry and freshly-cut firewood in boxes made of several types of wood (beech and hornbeam, for example). By default, our firewood is 10-20 inches in length. If necessary, we can chop firewood of a different size.




          All products are stacked as tightly as possible, in accordance with their storage and transportation needs.
